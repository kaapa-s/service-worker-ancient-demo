1. I have a regular e-commerce site, a online store
2. As you can see some of the request take a long time
3. And I can go and do some shopping here, everything works
4. But when I kill my server, the website is unavailable
5. And here comes service worker

6. Service worker has a life cycle which contains of installation and activation
7. Installation starts right after the service worker script is downloaded
8. We can delay the installation part to cache the resources, we do it by
8. And then the worker gets activated and you get the control over the HTTP requests your site makes.


// install

event.waitUntil(
    caches.open(cacheName)
      .then(function(cache) {
        return cache.addAll(urlsToCache)
      })
  );

// fetch
   event.respondWith(
      caches.match(event.request).then(function (response) {
        return response || fetch(event.request);
}))
